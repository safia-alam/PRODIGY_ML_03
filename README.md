Thank you for the clarification, Safia! Based on how I gave you README and LinkedIn content for **Task 1 (House Prices EDA)** and **Task 2 (Customer Segmentation)**, here is the **complete and structured README** and **LinkedIn content** for **Task 3: Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM (Color Images)** — exactly in that clean, presentable format:

# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM (Task 3 – Prodigy InfoTech)

### 🔍 Internship Task – Prodigy InfoTech

**Task 3: Create an SVM model to classify images of cats vs dogs using the Kaggle dataset.**
This project involves building a machine learning model using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to classify color images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

---

## 📁 Dataset Details

* **Source**: [Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

* **Structure**:

  ```
  train/
  ├── cats/
  └── dogs/
  ```

* **Images**: JPEG images of varying dimensions

* **Classes**:

  * `0` → Cat
  * `1` → Dog

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy, Pandas
* OpenCV (for image loading and resizing)
* Scikit-learn (for SVM model)
* Matplotlib (for visualization)

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**

   * Loaded 1000 cat images and 1000 dog images from `train/` directory.
   * Resized each image to **100x100** pixels (keeping 3 color channels).
   * Flattened the images (100 x 100 x 3 = 30000 features per image).
   * Created corresponding labels (0 for cat, 1 for dog).

2. **Train-Test Split**

   * Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing using `train_test_split`.

3. **Model Building**

   * Used `SVC(kernel='rbf')` from scikit-learn.
   * Trained the model on the color image features.

4. **Evaluation**

   * Evaluated using accuracy score and classification report.
   * Visualized prediction output for a random test sample.

---

## 📊 Results

* **Accuracy**: \~85%
* **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report** showed good generalization on unseen data.
* Successfully predicted random samples with image visualization.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

* SVM works well on flattened color images for binary classification.
* Color information improved model performance compared to grayscale.
* Model is lightweight and quick to train on a small dataset.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Improve accuracy using Deep Learning (CNN).
* Build a web app using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
* Add image augmentation for better generalization.
